This file contains bird densities for each site, which have been calculated through DISTANCE software. 
Intact and restored density values are the result of averages between point count and line transect surveys weighted by survey effort while afforested density values are the 
only from point count surveys. The % cover and heights for different habitat layers measured at each site are also included.
